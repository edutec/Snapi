###Snapi! - APIs and OpenData

Snapi! is a Snap! modification that features new blocks aimed
at working with APIs and OpenData.

You'll find blocks to deal with the JSON exchange format, access
REST APIs, treat colors as first-class citizens, represent information
in maps or stamp images fetched straight from Internet URLs.

Additionally, you'll find new tools that make working with JSON a
breeze, as well as a complete world map integration with its several
related tools and functionalites.
